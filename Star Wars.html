	<h2>The Jedi Order, Missionaries, and The Force</h2>
	</section>
	<p>The Star Wars prequel trilogy (episodes I, II, III The Phantom Menace, The Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith, respectively) have a tarnished image in the Star Wars "culture". On my mission, what little I knew of the Jedi reminded me of my fellow missionaries and me. We travelled in pairs or trios, dressed modestly, and the public deemed us very peculiar. When I returned from the mission and watched the prequel trilogy again, I realized WHY it’s a poor story: it’s the story of a missionary... a disobedient missionary.</p>
	
	<p>A missionary who gets married in the mission, murders, and destroys his order.</p>
	
	<p>The story is so harshly judged because of its parallels to reality. While destroying the Jedi order and donning a black mechanical suit may not be in our cards, personal corruption certainly is. As are the seduction of power and eventual pain and suffering caused by poorly made choices. Anakin lost his way and let his passions consume him. While he returned, it may not be so easy for us. May we endeavor to align ourselves with the "light side" by standing in holy places, by bridling our passions and by following not just the ways of the Force, but also the ways of its Creator.</p>
