	<h2>In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit...</h2>
	</section>
	<p>Tolkien’s works, namely The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings books, are absolutely inspiring. I have so much respect for the imagination, talent, and lessons on moral and spiritual goodness Tolkien wove into his stories.</p>
	<p>As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ and a devout student of the Savior’s gospel, my soul resonates with every religious and secular symbol, message, and theme that appears in all of Tolkien’s canon.</p>
	<p>As a man trying to find his way through the ups and downs of life, these books give me hope in a greater purpose and gratitude for human strength and perseverance.</p>
	<p>As a Tolkien fan, my mind is blown by the detail of the history, races, languages, and entire world he created for readers to enjoy and learn from.</p>
	<p>(Additional text concerning my husband’s thoughts will be coming soon. Probably some mini articles.)</p>

		<h3>The Little People</h3>
	</section>
	
	<p>Having just celebrated St. Patrick’s Day, we should be inspired to remember the missionary work of our dear, not-so-Latter-Day-Saint fellow: J. R. R. Tolkien.  Along with this remembrance comes the celebration of bringing knowledge of Christ to Ireland, Gaelic culture, and tradition. As my celebration included eating potatoes, cabbage, wearing my Irish kilt, and researching my ancestors from Dublin and Louth Counties, I watched “Darby O’Gill and the Little People”.
	</p>
	<p>I have loved the movie ever since I first saw it, but I this time around I noticed something more: the overall theme was LOVE. Being granted three wishes by the king of leprechauns, Darby wished 1. to protect his wishes, 2. to let others know of his friend, King Brian, and 3. to die in place of his daughter.</p>
	<p>But after agreeing with King Brian (the two friends wished they could travel to the afterlife together), Darby accidentally made a fourth wish, thus breaking the rule of wishes and voiding the preceding ones. So King Brian returned Darby from the coach of death (which must always bear someone from this life once called) to his home, the king of the leprechauns remaining in the cart.</p>
	<p>The fate of King Brian was a point of discussion for my wife and me. For no matter the consequences, Kind Brian showed his love for his friend. By masterminding the reversal of his friend’s cruel fate, King Brian allowed Darby to return to Darby’s family.</p>
	<p>My love of the little people is boundless. I have always enjoyed the belief in the existence of little peoples akin to Hobbits, leprechauns, fairies, etc. Nevertheless, whether that belief being in vain or not, I still have faith that the “little people” will always remain. By this I mean that people who do small, good deeds, who everyday go out of their way to show kindness, who “keep the darkness at bay”, will remain faithful in this life. As we remain, in the words of Treebeard the Ent, “the Hobbit children, the laughing folk, the little people,” we will grow closer together. So we must put on more Hobbit-ish social qualities, enjoying the garden, good company, and all the love that us little people can manage. By doing so, we will be better prepared for the world to come, and for He who reigns it.</p>
