	<h2>Our Story</h2>
	</section>
	<p>Im just a relatively simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy, and you're about to find out just how awesomely weird I am! From a quirky dude with lots of hobbies and unique outlooks on life comes a whole lotta exciting content!</p>
	<p>My wife, Morgan, says I’m a man a few words, which is true unless you ask me about my favorite “stir-the-pot” topics. This website is the place where I share my thoughts on all things controversial, cool, and creepy. Topics like The Mandalorian, LOTR, aliens, Bigfoot, American and Israel relations, fishing, murder stories, The Elder Scrolls and SO many other cool things are what I’ll be discussing, and I invite you to share your thoughts and arguments on these topics as well. Let’s get some debates going!</p>
	<p> Morgan and I are also quite crafty. From handmade fishing flies to holiday décor, we’ve got a unique selection of functional gifts perfect for treating yourself or pampering a loved one. Check out the items in our <a href="Store.html">store</a>, and happy browsing!</p>
